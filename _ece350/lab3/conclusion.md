**If you completed the lab using a USRP, please unplug your USRP's power cable before leaving the lab.**

## Deliverables

- 2 GRC files (submit these in their current state/final form from the lab):
  - an FM transmitter (`FM_transmitter.grc`)
  - an FM receiver (`FM_receiver.grc`)
- A single page with answers to the questions posed throughout the lab.
  - There are 3 questions which are all carefully labelled **Deliverable Question X**. Each question should take only one to two sentences to answer and address the concepts being explored.

If you are unsure how to submit the deliverables, ask your TA.
