## Objectives

This part of the lab is a guide to receiving real FM signal waveforms. You will:

- use the previously used delay-conjugate demodulation method to receive real signals and listen to FM radio
- learn the theory of cross-modulation

---

## Part 3 Deliverables

- There are 3 questions in this part. They are clearly indicated.
  - Each question requires approximately 1 line of writing, and addresses a concept, not details. Answer the questions and submit a single page containing the answers to your TA at the end of the lab.
