In this lab you used a USRP to both transmit and receive complex data streams. You then built an SSB demodulator.

**If you completed this lab in A309 please unplug your USRP's power cable before leaving the room.**

## Deliverables

- 2 GRC files (submit these in their current state/final form from the lab):
  - a resampling SSB receiver using Weaver\'s method (`SSB_DAT_demodulator.grc`)
  - a direct sampling SSB receiver using Weaver\'s method (`SSB_WAV_demodulator.grc`)
- The written answers to the questions posed throughout the lab.
  - There are 4 questions which are all carefully labelled **Deliverable Question X**. Each question should take only one to two sentences to answer and address the concepts being explored.

If you are unsure how to submit the deliverables, ask your TA.
