This lab is meant to be a supplement to your ECE450 class. It will provide you with a way to explore the concepts and techniques discussed in class in a more hands on way. The course requires access to GNU Radio ([free and open-sourced](https://www.gnuradio.org/)), and either Python ([free and open-sourced](https://www.python.org/)) or Matlab ([available for free to UVic students](https://www.matlab.uvic.ca)).

If you are unfamiliar with GNU Radio, it is strongly recommended that you complete the [introductory GRC tutorials]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _GRC-tutorials/introduction.md%}) hosted on this site before trying these labs.

## Labs

- Lab 1 - Communication in AWGN channels
- Lab 2 - Pulse-shaping and matched filters
- Lab 3 - Non-coherent and coherent BFSK
- Lab 4 - Coherent BPSK and non-coherent DPSK

## Deliverables

The deliverables are different for each lab and are described at the beginning of each. There are no lab reports required.

## Asynchronicity

These labs are all designed to be done independently from a personal (or lab) computer. It is possible to complete the entire course's lab requirement without sitting through designated "lab hours". As such, you are encouraged to work at your own pace, **using the scheduled lab period as a time to get assistance from a TA or the course instructor**.
